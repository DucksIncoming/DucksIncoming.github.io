                <p class="section-body">Construct and program a mechanism that translates speech spoken into a microphone into understandable morse code tapped
                     on the arm of the person wearing the mechanism. This project could have applications for people who are hard of hearing, deaf, or have 
                     trouble processing speech as it is spoken, especially as it does not require other speakers to understand a separate form of communication 
                     such as sign language. It’s performance is dependent primarily on its ease of use and reliability.

                <p class="section-body">
                    This project was made using Python and Visual Studio Code. In order to produce the results expected, there are three primary components that 
                    must be considered and fabricated. The first of these components is the speech recognition module. In order to translate the speech spoken 
                    into the microphone into morse code, the spoken speech must first be converted into text for the computer to parse. Using the Google Cloud’s 
                    speech recognition API, along with a Python library that allows easy access to its functionality, this component can be implemented after some 
                    settings are tweaked. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    The second component is the morse code translator that translates the speech from the microphone into morse code. Because morse code operates 
                    using individual letters rather than entire words, a function that intakes a single character and returns the morse code equivalent can be 
                    implemented for each individual character of the returned speech from the speech recognition module. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    Finally, the physical tapping mechanism must be built as the final component. The tapping mechanism is built using an arduino nano with a 
                    breadboard that is connected to a SG90 servo motor. This motor receives commands from the Python program dictating the position it must rotate 
                    to. The morse code output from the morse code translator can be passed into a handler function that dictates the timings for the servo motor 
                    given standard morse code timing and a global variable that alters its overall speed while retaining the proportional differences in certain 
                    timings. Finally, using the pyfirmata library to interface with the microcontroller, these commands and timings can be sent to the morse code 
                    tapper. Following this, the tapper mechanism can be mounted to the arm of a wearer and the project will be fully functional.

                    Overall, the project worked extremely well and functions exactly as intended. It’s design is compact enough to be mounted to the wearer’s arm and 
                    the responsiveness of the speech-to-text API makes utilizing the project reasonable. The project, however, suffers from a few core issues. The speed 
                    of the tapper makes longer sentences tedious and difficult to retain in memory when coupled with the requirement of translating the morse code back 
                    into english for the wearer. The project in itself serves as more of a learning opportunity and proof of concept, however, therefore these issues 
                    are not of extreme importance. Overall, the project was a great success and assisted in my process of learning arduino and servo functionality.
