                <p class="section-body">Construct a chess game for entertainment that shocks the user using a low-power taser when they make a poor move. 
                    The purpose of this is largely for entertainment and does not cause significant pain or damage to the players, but rather to serve as a 
                    fun, seemingly more risky alternative to traditional chess. The performance of the project was analyzed based on the effectiveness of the 
                    program deciding which moves were badly made and the amount of enjoyment the players expressed after playing.

                    This project was made using Python, pygame and Visual Studio Code. At its core, this project consists of a chess position evaluator, a move 
                    scoring system, and a taser that can be activated through code. First, the chess position evaluator was developed. Using a subpackage of 
                    Python’s chess library, the popular Stockfish chess engine can be implemented into the project. Because Stockfish focuses on automatically 
                    generating moves, however, it cannot be simply referenced in its basic form. By digging through the Stockfish source code, however, the 
                    evaluation function can be extracted and isolated. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    By forcing the position of the visible chess board to the position Stockfish keeps in memory, we can achieve an accurate evaluation of the 
                    board at its current state. After the player makes a move, the board is reevaluated using the same function. The difference between the two 
                    scores provides an excellent approximation of the overall board value lost through the move. Because Stockfish sees multiple moves in advance 
                    by calculating the best possible move using min-max optimization, it is incredibly unlikely that the player will make a move that is then 
                    evaluated as better than the move selected by Stockfish. Because of this, we can simply evaluate the difference between the two scores to 
                    determine the severity of the move. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    If the difference is past a certain threshold, the taser is activated for the player who made the move for a short period of time. The taser 
                    is activated using a signal sent through one of the digital pins on an arduino nano to a relay that is connected to two wires that were soldered 
                    to the taser’s button pins, thus activating the taser. Another digital pin is used for the taser for the other player to minimize cost. Once 
                    the taser is set up and the code is complete, the program can be run and played.

                    While this project has very few genuine real-world applications, its actual purpose was to further my understanding of microcontrollers, 
                    electronics, and programming using pyfirmata and arduino. Additionally, the technical challenge of analyzing chess game states and parsing 
                    the criteria to classify moves as well or poorly made improved my programming skills greatly and introduced me to new coding concepts that 
                    can be applied to future projects. Overall, the project worked as intended and greatly improved and reinforced my knowledge of electrical 
                    engineering and programming.
