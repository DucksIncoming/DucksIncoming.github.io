                <p class="section-body">The objective of this project was to recreate several real security devices in a low-cost, yet effective manner. The 
                    components made for this project were drawn from the Simplisafe product catalog, which included an entry sensor, panic button, glass break 
                    sensor, motion sensor, central unit, and keypad alarm disable. These components taken together were $294.87 cheaper than purchasing those 
                    components from the Simplisafe website.

                    This project was unique as there were a number of different components that needed to be created, each bringing their own unique challenges. 
                    The security system, named Cheaplisafe, is incredibly dependent on two components: the FS1000A 433MHz wireless transmitter and the XY-MK-5V 
                    wireless receiver modules. These two components allow for wireless communication between each of the systems using the RadioHead arduino library 
                    for communication handling. The system is reliant on these components for data transmission between each element of the system as it would not be 
                    practical or secure to have all six components hardwired together. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    A 173mm antenna was soldered to each of these wireless modules to increase their range and reliability. The first component to create was the central 
                    unit, which was responsible for receiving commands from other systems and activating an alarm. A multifunction button was also added for sending 
                    commands out to the other system components for opportunities for expansion into the future, however it was not used in this application. The alarm 
                    consisted of an active buzzer attached to the pin of an Arduino Nano 3.0, with a wireless transmitter/receiver pair for sending and receiving commands. 
                    The central unit has two alarm modes which are dictated by the component sending the alarm command, either “on_t” which activates the alarm only for a 
                    short period, and “on_p” which activates the alarm permanently until it is disabled by the keypad.

                    The second component made was the entry sensor module. Using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor, the distance between the module and the nearest solid 
                    surface can be determined. Using this, an expected value range can be programmed into the entry sensor. The module is then mounted to the door. Once this 
                    range is exceeded, such as when the door is opened and the distance to the nearest solid object changes, the system sends a command to the central unit to 
                    activate the alarm. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    The third component created was the panic button. This consisted of a push button wired as an input into the arduino, and thus when it is pushed the 
                    alarm command is sent. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    The fourth component created was the motion sensor, creating using a HC-SR501 motion sensor module. When the motion sensor detects changes in the infrared 
                    signature within its line of sight, the arduino will send the alarm command. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    The fifth component is the glass break sensor, created using a KY-037 sound sensor. After running a mathematical evaluation of the voltage read by the arduino 
                    from the sound sensor, converted into decibels, the alarm is activated if the reading is above a threshold of 90 dB. 
                </p>
                <p class="section-body">
                    Finally, the keypad was created using a membrane keypad module. Each keypress is saved on the arduino and added to a string, then transmits the saved code once the 
                    pound symbol is pressed. The central unit then checks this code against its saved password reference and disables the alarm if it is correct. Each of these modules
                     were tested individually for their functionality because multiple components were reused between modules.

                    Overall, the project worked extremely well and functions exactly as intended. It’s design is compact enough to be mounted to the wearer’s arm and 
                    the responsiveness of the speech-to-text API makes utilizing the project reasonable. The project, however, suffers from a few core issues. The speed 
                    of the tapper makes longer sentences tedious and difficult to retain in memory when coupled with the requirement of translating the morse code back 
                    into english for the wearer. The project in itself serves as more of a learning opportunity and proof of concept, however, therefore these issues 
                    are not of extreme importance. Overall, the project was a great success and assisted in my process of learning arduino and servo functionality.
